# Algorithmic Trading Strategy Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates an algorithmic trading strategy for stock market analysis using historical stock data. It leverages Python, SQL, Power BI, and Yahoo Finance API to analyze stock trends and calculate key financial indicators such as moving averages.

The goal of this project is to develop a basic trading algorithm, backtest its performance, and visualize the results using an interactive dashboard.

## Features
- **Data Import**: Retrieves historical stock data from Yahoo Finance API.
- **Data Analysis**: Performs basic analysis such as calculating moving averages.
- **Strategy Simulation**: Simulates a simple trading strategy based on the moving average crossover method.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the trading strategyâ€™s performance using metrics like total returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown.
- **Visualization**: Uses Power BI to visualize stock trends, trading signals, and portfolio performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data processing and strategy simulation.
- **SQL**: Storing and querying financial data.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Yahoo Finance API**: Retrieving stock price data.
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib**: Data manipulation and visualization.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x
2. Libraries:
    - `pandas`
    - `numpy`
    - `yfinance`
    - `matplotlib`
    - `sqlalchemy`
    - `sqlite` (or any SQL database you are using)
   
   You can install these libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy yfinance matplotlib sqlalchemy
   ```

3. Power BI (for visualization)

### Steps to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithmic-trading-simulation.git
   ```

2. **Data Import**: The script will fetch stock data using Yahoo Finance API.
   You can specify the stock ticker and the date range in the script.

3. **Run the strategy simulation**: The strategy uses simple moving average crossovers to determine buy/sell signals.

4. **Store results**: The results will be saved in a SQL database (or file) for further analysis.

5. **Visualization**: Open the Power BI dashboard to visualize stock trends, performance, and trading signals.

## Example Usage
```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the stock ticker and date range
ticker = "AAPL"
start_date = "2020-01-01"
end_date = "2023-01-01"

# Fetch the stock data from Yahoo Finance
data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Calculate moving averages
data['MA50'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
data['MA200'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Simulate trading strategy based on MA crossover
data['Signal'] = 0
data['Signal'][data['MA50'] > data['MA200']] = 1  # Buy Signal
data['Signal'][data['MA50'] < data['MA200']] = -1  # Sell Signal
```

## Results
- The backtesting of the strategy will show the performance of the stock trades based on the buy/sell signals.
- The performance metrics include total returns, maximum drawdown, and Sharpe ratio.
